Admin

From the admin perspective, we must click on the admin link on the main page. We are redirected to a new site where
we have a panel on the left. On the panel, there are links for each relation in the database. Once a database is clicked,
an admin user can add, delete or update tuples on this relation.

When the user first enters the website, the home page as shown in Figure 1.1 can be seen. When the user clicks the admin panel
link on the bottom corner of figure 1.1, they are redirected to the admin panel in figure 1.2. There, they can choose to initialize
the database or to edit a table in the navigation bar to the left. As an example, if the edit players link is clicked on the left, the
table in figure 1.3 comes up and the admin is able to edit the players of the database web application.
