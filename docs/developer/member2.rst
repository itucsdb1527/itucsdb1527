**Creating Table**

.. code-block:: python

    @app.route('/initdb')
    def initialize_database():
       connection = dbapi2.connect(app.config['dsn'])
       cursor =connection.cursor()

       query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS TEAMS CASCADE"""
       cursor.execute(query)

       query = """CREATE TABLE TEAMS(
       ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       Team_Name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
       Leagues_ID INTEGER,
       FOREIGN KEY (Leagues_ID) REFERENCES LEAGUES(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
       )"""
       cursor.execute(query)

|
Teams table is created as seen above. It is cascade on both update and delete. It has 3 columns which are ID, Team_Name and Leagues_ID. Leagues_ID is foreign key references to Leagues table's ID.

   ID is auto incremented, integer and primary key.

   Team_Name is varchar and cannot be NULL.

   Leagues_ID is integer and foreign key.
|

**Inserting Elements**

.. code-block:: python

    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Galatasaray',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Besiktas',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Fenerbahce',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Ziraat Bankasi',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Halkbank',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Istanbul B.S.B.',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Sahinbey Bld.',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Maliye Milli Piyango',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Tokat Bld. Plevne',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Inegol Bld.',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Arkas Spor',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Bornova Anadolu Lisesi',1)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('IBB Polonia London',2)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Team Northumbria',2)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('London Docklands',2)"""
    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Wessex M1',2)"""

    cursor.execute(query)
    query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID) VALUES ('Malory Eagles (London)',2)"""
    cursor.execute(query)

Datas for teams table are added as seen above.

   ID is not added above because it is auto increment (by using SERIAL).

   Team_Name is added between quotes ('') because it is varchar.

   Leagues_ID is added by writing  an integer. There is no need to use quotes ('') while adding integer.
|

**Listing and Inserting**

.. code-block:: python

   @app.route('/ADMIN/teams', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def admin_teams_page():
       connection = dbapi2.connect(app.config['dsn'])
       cursor = connection.cursor()

       if request.method == 'GET':
           query = "SELECT TEAMS.ID, TEAMS.Team_Name, LEAGUES.League_Name FROM TEAMS INNER JOIN LEAGUES ON TEAMS.Leagues_ID = LEAGUES.ID ORDER BY ID"
           cursor.execute(query)

           cursor2 = connection.cursor()
           query = "SELECT ID, League_Name FROM LEAGUES"
           cursor2.execute(query)

           return render_template('admin/teams.html', teams = cursor, leagues = cursor2)
       else:

           name = request.form['name']
           leagues_id = request.form['leagues_id']
           query = """INSERT INTO TEAMS (Team_Name, Leagues_ID)
           VALUES ('"""+name+"','"+leagues_id+"')"
           cursor.execute(query)
           connection.commit()
           return redirect(url_for('admin_teams_page'))

|
Listing occurs in the if condition using 'GET' method.

In the else part, Team_Name and Leagues_ID is taken from the user and inserted to teams table.

After execution, developer returns admin page for teams.

|

**Searching**

.. code-block:: python

   @app.route('/teams', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def teams_page():
       connection = dbapi2.connect(app.config['dsn'])
       cursor = connection.cursor()

       if request.method == 'GET':
           query = "SELECT TEAMS.ID, TEAMS.Team_Name, LEAGUES.League_Name FROM TEAMS INNER JOIN LEAGUES ON TEAMS.Leagues_ID = LEAGUES.ID ORDER BY ID"
           cursor.execute(query)
           return render_template('teams.html', teams = cursor)
       else:
           search = request.form['search']
           query = "SELECT TEAMS.ID, TEAMS.Team_Name, LEAGUES.League_Name FROM TEAMS INNER JOIN LEAGUES ON TEAMS.Leagues_ID = LEAGUES.ID WHERE TEAMS.Team_Name LIKE '%" + search +"%'"
           cursor.execute(query)
           connection.commit()
           return render_template('teams.html', teams = cursor)

|
In the if part, it lists all of the datas.

If user wants to search for any specific team name, searching occurs in the else part.

|

**Deleting**

.. code-block:: python

   @app.route('/ADMIN/teams/DELETE/<int:DELETEID>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def admin_teams_page_delete(DELETEID):
           connection = dbapi2.connect(app.config['dsn'])
           cursor = connection.cursor()
           cursor.execute("""DELETE FROM TEAMS WHERE ID = %s""", (int(DELETEID),))
           connection.commit()
           return redirect(url_for('admin_teams_page'))

|
When delete is encountered, selected data is deleted from the table using its ID.

After execution, developer returns admin page for teams.

|

**Updating**

.. code-block:: python

   @app.route('/ADMIN/teams/UPDATE/<int:UPDATEID>/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def admin_teams_page_update(UPDATEID):
       connection = dbapi2.connect(app.config['dsn'])
       cursor = connection.cursor()

       cursor2 = connection.cursor()
       query = "SELECT ID, League_Name FROM LEAGUES"
       cursor2.execute(query)

       cursor.execute("""SELECT ID, Team_Name FROM TEAMS WHERE ID = %s""", (int(UPDATEID),))
       connection.commit()
       return render_template('admin/teams_edit.html', teams = cursor, leagues = cursor2)

   @app.route('/ADMIN/teams/UPDATE/<int:UPDATEID>/APPLY', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def admin_teams_page_apply(UPDATEID):
       connection = dbapi2.connect(app.config['dsn'])
       cursor = connection.cursor()

       new_name = request.form['name']
       new_leagues_id = request.form['leagues_id']
       query = """UPDATE TEAMS SET Team_Name = '%s', Leagues_ID = '%d' WHERE ID = %d""" % (new_name, int(new_leagues_id), int(UPDATEID))
       cursor.execute(query)
       connection.commit()
       return redirect(url_for('admin_teams_page'))

|
In the first @app.route, leagues table is opened because any team's league may also change while editing teams.

When any row's update button is clicked, clicked row's ID is taken as UPDATEID.

In the second @app.route, new team name and league name will be taken.

Finally, update occurs.

       query = """CREATE TABLE SEASON_TEAM(
       ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       Season_ID INTEGER,
       Team_ID INTEGER,
       FOREIGN KEY (Season_ID) REFERENCES SEASONS(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
       FOREIGN KEY (Team_ID) REFERENCES TEAMS(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
       )"""
       cursor.execute(query)

|
